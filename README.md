# Description

The goal of this website refactor was to optimize the site for SEO and to clean up any code that is not working and/or not using semantic HTML.  All links and function will be adjusted if needed to create a clean, functioning website that is useful to the user and show clean code to help any additional programmers in the future.  Comments will be present to clearly show the reason for the adjustments to provide any clarification needed.

# Example of changing to semantic HTML for clarity




# Learning points

Using consistent semantic HTML makes adjustments and debugging easier for everyone and making sure comments are used to provide other collaborators the reason why.  These help the user and the collaborator's experience with the site a positive one.
